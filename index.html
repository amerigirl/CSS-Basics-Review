        Something excited happened...well something exciting happened, but it
        wasn't for me, lol! One of the people in my cohort of contract workers
        was hired on as a full time employee! That was so great to hear for
        them! I was a bit nervous all of a sudden: am I good enough to be hired
        on as an FTE? Will I make the cut? and if I don't, who's "fault" is
        that? Is it anybody's fault when you don't get hired on after an
        interview? Doesn't that just mean you weren't the best fit for the job?
        I think that s what it means. I just sucks because we all want to be a
        good fit. If you're look for work, what you want more than anything is
        for someone to say you made the cut. If I don't make the cut, I will do
        what I do best: keep looking for work. But it's a bit demoralizing. It's
        hard to deal with, not being a good fit for a role when you think you
        are.<br /><br />

        Another issue is how do congratulate others when we are hurting inside?
        How do we congratulate others when we feel like it should ALSO be us? I
        think the key is staying positive and realizing if they didn't want us,
        that wasn't the right place for us in the beginning. That's just so much
        easier said than done.

        Ok so the more I think about it, the more I'm reminded of how we sell ourselves short in life.  Why am I not in line for a job that I'm good at, a job that I've prepped for: a job that I want?  Why is it because someone else has gotten what they want that I think I won't or DON'T deserve the same?  It's sad really, how easily we doubt and defeat ourselves before we begin.  I've worked hard and I DO fit that job: I did a great job according to my boss; I absolutely loved working with my mentor on the team; I felt I learned a lot from him and he even said I taught him a thing or two. <br><br> Unless you've been chronically out of work for months, it's hard to explain how easily self-doubt, fear, and so much more can hold you back.  So yes, I'm happy someone else was given a role that they'd be a good fit for--and YES, I will be next!
